# Module 2 Challenge

## Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

- Our objective in this challenge project was to create a personal portfolio website that demonstrated to employers our ability to construct a website,
make it responsive and accessible, as well as display and link to examples of projects we've completed so far throughout this class. 

- This was both an exciting and challenging project as it brought together our knowledge to create and style a website from scratch, stylize it using CSS, and make it responsive and functional all while holding space to demonstrate our work projects to potential employers. 

- This was a great learning experience and an opportunity to be able to seek out tools and resources for things I might not be well-versed on in order to make 
a better functioning website and be a great example of a home portfolio page that I can update and utilize in the future. 

- For much of the CSS styling, I got a lot of inspiration from Kevin Powell and his tutorials. This was very helpful throughout this project as CSS is one of the areas that can be challenging for me, but through more research on this challenge, I feel like I have a much better grasp of these concepts.
